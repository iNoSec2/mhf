# Mobile Helper Framework

is a tool that automates the process of identifying the framework/technology used to create a mobile application. Additionally, it assists in finding sensitive information or provides suggestions for working with the identified platform.

## How work?

The tool searches for files associated with the technologies used in mobile application development, such as configuration files, resource files, and source code files.

## Example

### Cordova

Search files:

```
index.html
cordova.js
cordova_plugins.js
```
### React Native Android & iOS

Search file

```
Andorid files:

libreactnativejni.so
index.android.bundle

iOS files:

main.jsbundle
```

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

`python3 mobile_helper_framework.py app.apk|ipa|aab`

### Examples

```
python3 mobile_helper_framework.py file.apk

[+] App was written in React Native

Do you want analizy the application (y/n) y

Output directory already exists. Skipping decompilation.

Beauty the react code? (y/n) n

Search any info? (y/n) y

==>>Searching possible internal IPs in the file

==>>Searching possible emails in the file

==>>Searching possible interesting words in the file

==>>Searching Private Keys in the file

==>>Searching high confidential secrets

==>>Searching possible sensitive URLs in js files

==>>Searching possible endpoints in js files results.........
```

## Features

This tool uses Apktool for decompilation of Android applications.

This tool renames the .ipa file of iOS applications to .zip and extracts the contents.

`What is patching apk:` This tool uses Reflutter, a framework that assists with reverse engineering of Flutter apps using a patched version of the Flutter library.

`Split APKs` is a technique used by Android to reduce the size of an application and allow users to download and use only the necessary parts of the application.

Instead of downloading a complete application in a single APK file, Split APKs divide the application into several smaller APK files, each of which contains only a part of the application such as resources, code libraries, assets, and configuration files.

```
adb shell pm path com.package
package:/data/app/com.package-NW8ZbgI5VPzvSZ1NgMa4CQ==/base.apk
package:/data/app/com.package-NW8ZbgI5VPzvSZ1NgMa4CQ==/split_config.arm64_v8a.apk
package:/data/app/com.package-NW8ZbgI5VPzvSZ1NgMa4CQ==/split_config.en.apk
package:/data/app/com.package-NW8ZbgI5VPzvSZ1NgMa4CQ==/split_config.xxhdpi.apk
```
For example, in Flutter if the application is a Split it's necessary patch split_config.arm64_v8a.apk, this file contains libflutter.so
